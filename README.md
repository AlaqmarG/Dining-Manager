# Dining-Manager
## Project Disclaimer
This is a project for my CBSE High School Senior Year, and it is not recommended to use this program for daily use.
Although if you wish to fork this repository and further expand this project to suit your personal or commercial needs, please feel free to do so.

## About the Project
The Dining Manager is software allowing you to keep track of your tables and their orders in a Resturant Dining Environment. It allows you to set easily identifiable custom names for every table you create, and also allows you to store information about the items order by a given table. Do note, data is only stored on memeory and doesn't save between sessions.

## Limitaions
The program doesn't scale well on devices with different screen sizes.
The program quite limited in the features it offers, and the names of items and tables need to be typed through a keyboard.
